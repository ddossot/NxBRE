<!-- ENTITY Declarations -->
<!-- in this ruleml-datalog.dtd, parameter entities set two *.module switches to INCLUDE -->
<!ENTITY % datalog.module "INCLUDE">
<!ENTITY % datalog-and-hornlog.module "INCLUDE">

<!-- hence all conditional sections "<![%*.module;[" . . . "]]>" activate their content; -->
<!-- in a stand-alone use of the current DTD "<![%*.module;[" and "]]>" are thus no-ops -->
<!-- ENTITY and ATTLIST Declarations only for upward compatibility with XML Schema -->
<!-- URI-valued (CDATA) attributes optionally specify an XML Schema on 'rulebase' root -->
<!ENTITY % URI "CDATA">
<!ATTLIST rulebase xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation %URI; #IMPLIED>
<!ATTLIST rulebase xmlns:xsi %URI; #IMPLIED>

<!-- ELEMENT and ATTLIST Declarations -->
<!-- 'rulebase' root element uses 'imp' rules and 'fact' assertions along with 'query' tests as top-level elements -->
<!-- It has an optional label.  -->
<!-- direction attribute indicates the intended direction of imp inferencing;  -->
<!-- it is a preliminary design choice and has a 'neutral' default value -->
<!ELEMENT rulebase (( (_rbaselab, (imp | fact | query)* ) | ((imp | fact | query)+, _rbaselab?) )?) >
<!ATTLIST rulebase direction (forward | backward | bidirectional) "bidirectional">

<!-- 'imp' is short for "implication"; it is a kind of rule -->
<!-- 'imp' rules are usable on the rulebase top-level -->
<!-- 'imp' element uses a conclusion role _head followed by a premise role _body, or equivalently -->
<!-- (since roles constitute unordered elements), uses a premise role _body followed by a conclusion role _head -->
<!-- "<imp>_head _body</imp>" stands for "_head is implied by _body", i.e., "_head is true is implied by _body is true", or equivalently, -->
<!-- "<imp>_body _head</imp>" stands for "_body implies _head", i.e., "_body is true implies _head is true" -->

<!-- 'fact' assertions are usable as degenerate rules on the rulebase top-level -->
<!-- 'fact' element uses just a conclusion role _head -->
<!-- "<fact>_head</fact>" stands for "_head is implied by true", i.e., "_head is true" -->
<!-- "_rlab" is a handle for the fact: for various uses, including editing -->
<!-- NOTE:  for now, fact is not required to be ground -->
<!-- FUTURE DESIGN:  perhaps require fact to be ground; 
     note that any requirement of groundedness of fact's must be enforced beyond the DTD validation -->

<!-- 'query' elements are usable as degenerate rules on the rulebase top-level -->
<!-- 'query' element uses just a premise role _body -->
<!-- "<query>_body</query>" stands for "false is implied by _body", i.e., "_body cannot be proved", which is to be refuted by generating the bindings for free variables in _body -->
<!-- "_rlab" is a handle for the query: for various uses, including editing -->
